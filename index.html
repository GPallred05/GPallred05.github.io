                        the topic of the paper was the impending limitations of technology and job automation from artificial intelligence.

                    <h3>Computers</h3>
                    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is probably computers. Ever since I got into them about 4 years ago, I've built
                        7 or 8 computers, including 2 of my own. The others were all my friends that needed help building theirs, and 
                        now we all play together.

                    <h3>Rubik's Cube</h3>
                    <p>Another hobby that I like is collecting and solving different Rubik's cubes. Puzzles in general interest me
                        and I like to put my brain to work by trying to solve them. I think my current best time is 34 seconds!

                    <h3>My Future</h3>
                    <p>Currently, my plans for the future are to, obviously, gradute college with a degree in either computer science or computer engineering.
                        Lately, I've been leaning more towards computer engineering because the hardware part of computers is what I'm really interested in.
                        So after college, I would like to be working for some large company like Intel or Nvidia to create computer parts.
