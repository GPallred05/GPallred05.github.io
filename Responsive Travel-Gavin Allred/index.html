            Park Summary

        <p>
            Yellowstone National Park is a huge wilderness recreation area that sits on top of a
            volcanic hot spot and spans nearly 3,500 square miles. The park has many features, 
            from canyons, rivers, and forests to hot springs and geysers. Although the park is 
            located mostly in Wyoming, it reaches to some parts of Montana and Idaho as well.

            Park History
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yellowstone National Park has rich human and ecological stories that continue to unfold. 
            People have spent time in the Yellowstone region for more than 11,000 years. Many tribes 
            and bands used the park as their home, hunting grounds, and transportation routes prior 
            to and after European American arrival. Yellowstone was established as the world's first 
            national park in 1872.
